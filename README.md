## Object Detection Model

This project was for my mini-project course. A basic object detection pretrained model of Yolo.
In this we have multiple options like upload image to classify object in the image,
And then we have live image classification model,
And then cursor control via hand movements.

It was interesting project where I got to learn about yolo models.
